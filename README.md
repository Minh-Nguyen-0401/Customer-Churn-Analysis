# Customer Churn Prediction Project

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing predictive models to assess the likelihood of customers leaving a business. By understanding and addressing customer attrition, businesses in industries such as telecommunications, internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services can implement effective retention strategies.

### Problem Statement

Customer churn prediction is crucial for business management in sectors like telecommunications, internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services. It involves understanding and addressing customer attritionâ€”the loss of clients or customers. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction essential for prioritizing retention efforts and maximizing long-term value.

### Key Questions

1. **What is the significance of Churn Rate for stakeholders (Customers, MCI, etc.)?**
2. **What are the characteristics of each Type of Customer (Churn or Not Churn)?**
3. **Which ML models can be implemented and how do they perform?** Including feature inputs and importance.
4. **What qualitative and quantitative actions could enhance retention rates?**

### Keywords

Binary Classification, Python, EDA, Statistical Significance

## Machine Learning Model Development Pipeline

After refining features during Feature Engineering, this section outlines the steps to build and deploy the Machine Learning Model:

1. **Shortlist ML Models**: Utilize Ensemble Learning Models like XGBoost and LightGBM to address class imbalance and prevent overfitting.
2. **Assess Resampling Needs**: Consider SMOTE upsampling if necessary.
3. **Generate Dataset Versions**: Create two separate training and holdout datasets to evaluate specific features (`voice_mail_plan`, `intl_charge_per_min_cate`, `total_eve_calls`, `account_length`).
4. **Tune Hyperparameters with Grid Search CV**: Implement Grid Search for efficient hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Fit Optimized Models**: Train models on each dataset version.
6. **Compare Performance Metrics**: Evaluate using ROC AUC or precision-recall due to class imbalance.
7. **Adjust Features for Deployment**: Refine the final feature set.
8. **Final Model Implementation with BayesSearch CV & Interpretation**: Optimize hyperparameters with Bayes Search CV for final deployment.
